🧭 Project Overview
🚦 Project 1 — A (A-Star) Pathfinding*
**

An implementation of the A* algorithm, a cornerstone of pathfinding and graph traversal.

Source Code: Find the implementation in A star Algorithm/Code Files/.

Flow Charts: Understand the logic with diagrams in A star Algorithm/Flow Charts/.

Key Features:

Efficient Pathfinding: Finds the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles.

Heuristic Function: Uses an admissible heuristic (h(n)) to optimize the search process.

Grid-Based: Designed for grid worlds, perfect for games and simulations.

⚫ Project 2 — Checker Game with AI
**

A fully playable implementation of the classic board game of Checkers.

Source Code: The game logic is located in Checker game/Code Files/.

Video Demo: Watch the game in action in the Checker game/Video/ folder.

Key Features:

Playable Game: A complete two-player Checkers experience.

AI Opponent: Features an AI opponent, likely using a search algorithm like Minimax to decide the best move.

Interactive Gameplay: Designed for a user-friendly and interactive session.

⚔️ Project 3 — Battle Grid Game
**

A text-based or simple graphical tactical battle game played on a grid.

Source Code: Located in the root Code Files/ directory.

Game Data: The game's map or initial setup can be found in Battle Grid Game/battle_grid_game.txt.

Key Features:

Turn-Based Strategy: Engage in tactical, turn-based combat.

Grid Environment: All action takes place on a structured grid, requiring strategic positioning.

Customizable Scenarios: Modify the .txt file to create new battle scenarios.
