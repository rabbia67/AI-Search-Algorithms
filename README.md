## 🧭 Project Overview

### 🚦 Project 1 — A* (A-Star) Pathfinding
An implementation of the **A*** algorithm, a cornerstone of pathfinding and graph traversal.

- **Source Code**: Find the implementation in `A star Algorithm/Code Files/`
- **Flow Charts**: Understand the logic with diagrams in `A star Algorithm/Flow Charts/`

**Key Features:**
- 🏎 **Efficient Pathfinding** — Finds the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles.
- 🧠 **Heuristic Function** — Uses an admissible heuristic *(h(n))* to optimize the search process.
- 🗺 **Grid-Based** — Designed for grid worlds, perfect for games and simulations.

### ⚫ Project 2 — Checker Game with AI
A fully playable implementation of the classic board game **Checkers**.

- **Source Code**: The game logic is located in `Checker game/Code Files/`
- **Video Demo**: Watch the game in action in the `Checker game/Video/` folder.

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Playable Game** — Complete two-player Checkers experience.
- 🤖 **AI Opponent** — Features an AI opponent, likely using a search algorithm like **Minimax** to decide the best move.
- 🖱 **Interactive Gameplay** — User-friendly and interactive.
